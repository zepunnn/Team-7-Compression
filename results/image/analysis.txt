IMAGE COMPRESSION ANALYSIS
Dataset                 : dataset/image1.jpg

PSNR                     : 51.19 dB
Original File Size       : 666903 bytes
Compressed File Size     : 2545567 bytes
Compression Ratio        : 0.26

Trade-off Analysis:
Block-based DCT reduces spatial redundancy but may introduce
blocking artifacts, especially in high-frequency regions.

Visual Artifact:
Visible block boundaries may appear after reconstruction.
