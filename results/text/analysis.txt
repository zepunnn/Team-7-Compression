TEXT COMPRESSION ANALYSIS
Dataset                 : dataset/pg11-images-3.epub

Source Entropy           : 4.5763
Original File Size       : 170110 bytes
Compressed File Size     : 90178 bytes
Compression Ratio        : 1.89

Encoding Time            : 0.0464 seconds
Decoding Time            : 0.1324 seconds

Trade-off Analysis:
Lossless compression preserves text integrity while reducing
file size. Higher compression efficiency increases computational
overhead during encoding and decoding.
