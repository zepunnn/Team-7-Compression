# Team-7-Compression
This final project implements lossless data compression algorithms for textual documents using Python. Several entropy-based and dictionary-based methods are applied and evaluated based on compression ratio, entropy, and encoding–decoding time to demonstrate the practical application of coding and compression concepts.
